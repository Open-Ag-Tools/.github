# Open Ag Tools – Contribution Guidelines

## 🌱 Mission
Open Ag Tools is a community-driven organization dedicated to creating **open-source software and resources for agriculture**. Our mission is to make agricultural technology more accessible, interoperable, and useful for farmers, researchers, and developers worldwide.

## 📂 Types of Projects We Welcome
We encourage projects that align with the following themes:
- **Geospatial Tools** – GIS libraries, mapping tools, data visualization for fields, farms, and environmental datasets.
- **Data Standards & Formats** – schemas, converters, and utilities for agricultural datasets (e.g., soil data, yield data, weather records).
- **Analytics & Modeling** – soil fertility models, crop growth simulators, statistical or ML-based analysis tools.
- **APIs & Services** – open APIs that connect to public data sources (e.g., USDA, FAO, satellite imagery).
- **User-Facing Tools** – web or mobile applications that empower growers, agronomists, and students.
- **Interoperability Projects** – efforts that bridge agricultural data silos (e.g., import/export utilities, data pipelines).

## 🤝 How You Can Help
There are many ways to contribute, regardless of skill level:
- **Code Contributions**: Bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements.
- **Data Contributions**: Curated datasets, metadata standards, or schema proposals.
- **Design Contributions**: UI/UX design for tools and libraries.
- **Testing & Feedback**: Reporting bugs, performance issues, and usability improvements.
- **Community Contributions**: Writing tutorials, case studies, and educational content.

## 📖 Contribution Process
1. **Check for Existing Issues/Discussions** – See if your idea is already being discussed.
2. **Propose Your Idea** – Open a GitHub issue or start a discussion to get feedback.
3. **Fork & Branch** – Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and make your changes.
4. **Submit a Pull Request** – Clearly describe what you’ve added or fixed.
5. **Review & Merge** – Maintainers will review for quality, alignment, and clarity.

We encourage **small, focused contributions**—even small fixes make a big difference.

## 🌍 Community Values
- **Open & Accessible** – Tools should be available under open-source licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.).
- **Collaborative** – We work together across disciplines: coders, agronomists, farmers, and designers.
- **Practical & Useful** – Tools should solve real-world agricultural challenges.
- **Inclusive & Respectful** – Everyone is welcome; respect all contributors.

## 📜 Licensing & Ownership
- All projects should use a **permissive open-source license** (MIT, Apache-2.0, or similar).
- Contributors agree to license their work under the project’s license.
- Donated projects remain credited to their original creators while being maintained under the Open Ag Tools umbrella.
